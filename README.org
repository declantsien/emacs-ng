Would be easier if we just use Webrender as an alternative rendering engine like Cairo.
We could just obtain an OpenGL context from native_display_handle using surfman. Not sure
how much benefits we would gain from there, since the underline core is still Emacs's redisplay.

Also, Winit is in early stage. And Emacs Webrender output implementation is not fully finished yet.
